17th July 2023:
		Making movie from images using ffmpeg
		
		ffmpeg -framerate 25 -i image-%05d.jpg -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
		
		here :
			ffmpeg is the package
			
			-framerate - is number of frames per second
			
			-i image-%05d.jpg - determines the file name sequence it 				looks for. 				
			image- means all of the files start with this. The d 				indicates decimal integers, 5 is number of digits, the 				leading zero indicates that numbers requiring fewer digits 				will be filled, in the left, with zeroes so that every 				number contains exactly 5 digits. Thus the files it will 				detect are everything from image-00000 to image-99999.
			
			-c:v libx264 - the video codec is libx264 (H.264).
			
			-profile:v high - use H.264 High Profile (advanced features, 				better quality).
			
			-crf 20 - constant quality mode, very high quality (lower 				numbers are higher quality, 18 is the smallest you would 				want to use).
			
			-pix_fmt yuv420p - use YUV pixel format and 4:2:0
			
			output.mp4 - Output file name
			
	Note: = Remember that ffmpeg needs a continuous sequence of images to load in. If it 		        jumps from image-00001 to image-00003 it will stop.
			

11th Dec 2023: 	
		To increase the quality of image rendering in vmd

		In order to create high quality figures with VMD, go to: File > Render and use the Tachyon module in the File Render Controls panel.
		Also, in order to increase the resolution of the figure, go to Render Command, in the same panel, and add the flag: -res xxx yyy, defining the number of pixels of the image.
		Example:
			"/usr/local/lib/vmd/tachyon_LINUXAMD64" -aasamples 12 %s -format TARGA -res 1600 1200 -o %s.tga

			-dPrinted=false to preserve Hyperlinks
  			-dCompatibilityLevel from 1.4 to 1.5 as pdflatex outputs PDF 1.5 by default since 2010
  		
  		
 29th May 2024:
		To copy a particular directory excluding a subdirectory from that directory
