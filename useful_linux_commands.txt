17th July 2023:
		Making movie from images using ffmpeg
		
		ffmpeg -framerate 25 -i image-%05d.jpg -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
		
		here :
			ffmpeg is the package
			
			-framerate - is number of frames per second
			
			-i image-%05d.jpg - determines the file name sequence it 				looks for. 				
			image- means all of the files start with this. The d 				indicates decimal integers, 5 is number of digits, the 				leading zero indicates that numbers requiring fewer digits 				will be filled, in the left, with zeroes so that every 				number contains exactly 5 digits. Thus the files it will 				detect are everything from image-00000 to image-99999.
			
			-c:v libx264 - the video codec is libx264 (H.264).
			
			-profile:v high - use H.264 High Profile (advanced features, 				better quality).
			
			-crf 20 - constant quality mode, very high quality (lower 				numbers are higher quality, 18 is the smallest you would 				want to use).
			
			-pix_fmt yuv420p - use YUV pixel format and 4:2:0
			
			output.mp4 - Output file name
			
	Note: = Remember that ffmpeg needs a continuous sequence of images to load in. If it 		        jumps from image-00001 to image-00003 it will stop.
