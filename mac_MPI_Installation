Step to install MPICH on macbook pro

1. Download the mpich-4.1a1.zip(Right now it is on my HPC cluster)

2. Unzip mpich-4.1a1.zip it into home directory by following command
	
	unzip mpich-4.1a1.zip 

3. Enter to excrated mpich directory for this type the following command

	cd  mpich-4.1a1
	
4. Run the following command

	./configure  FC=ifort CC=ICC -prefix=<Home directory path>/mpich |& tee c.txt
		
		(in my case <home directory path> = /Users/absharma )

( here we are telling that while configure the system for fortran compiler use Intel fortran compiler which is ifort and for c compiler use intel c compiler which is icc )

5.  Then run the following commands

	make

6. And then run 

	make install
(Above commands will take more than half an hour)

7. Add the follwing lines to .zshrc and .bashrc in Mac (Since Mac has two shells)
	
	7a. To add .zshrc use this :
		
		sudo vi ~/.zshrc
				
		then add these following lines:
					
	export PATH="<home directory path>/mpich/bin:$PATH"
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	
	(in my case <home directory path> = /Users/absharma )
	
	7b. To add .bashrc use this :
	
		sudo vi ~/.bashrc
		
		then add the following lines :
		
	export PATH="<home directory path>/mpich/bin:$PATH"
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	
	(in my case <home directory path> = /Users/absharma )
	
8. Then source the both files by following commands
	
	source ~/.zshrc
	
	source ~/.bashrc
	
Now mpi is installed in your Mac

To chek just type mpi in terminal if there is an command line error that means you have done succussfully enjoy if not then findout the mistake and try the following steps again after cleaning all files.

 			Thank You
