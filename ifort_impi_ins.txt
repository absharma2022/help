vIn this text file I have mentioned the steps along with the links to download and install the ifort compiler and intel mpi libraries
These libraries comes with two packages first one is Intel Oneapi Base Toolkit (Develop performant, data-centric applications across Intel® CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs with this foundational toolset) and second is Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit (Build, analyze, and scale applications across shared- and distributed-memory computing systems). First tool is required to install and run the second tool, we can not use second tool without the first one. 
There is step by step guidelines to install both the tools: 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get and install the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit:

Open the following link in your browser :

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html

after the choose your operating system and select the option to download(I selected online, you can choose according your prefernece)
After doing his you will get two options either download package or use terminal command line, for terminal commnd line I got following link(you may get different as depends on upgradation)

Run these commands in sequence

wget https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/irc_nas/18970/l_BaseKit_p_2022.3.1.17310.sh

sudo sh ./l_BaseKit_p_2022.3.1.17310.sh   ###### This will launch the GUI Installer as the root you can customise your pacakges according to your need.

Follow the instructions in the installer.
Now we need to Configure our CPU or GPU System for this follow:
 
sudo apt update

sudo apt -y install cmake pkg-config build-essential

We can also verify the installation by displaying the installation location with this command: 

which cmake 

Now main things come to Set Environment Variables for CLI(Command Line Interface) Development
There are two ways for this:
 
Option 1: Source setvars.sh once per session (with every time opening the terminal): Source setvars.sh every time you open a new terminal window: 

. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

Option 2: One time setup for setvars.sh : Environment variables can be set up to automatically set using one of the methods below: 

sudo gedit /etc/bash.bashrc ## To open source file as a root

source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh intel64  ## add this command at the end of file and then save it and close it.


source /etc/bash.bashrc  ## Doing source changes made to source file(bash.bashrc)
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get and install the Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit:

Open the following link in your browser :

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit-download.html

after the choose your operating system and select the option to download(I selected online, you can choose according your prefernece)
After doing his you will get two options either download package or use terminal command line, for terminal commnd line I got following link(you may get different as depends on upgradation)
Run these commands in sequence

wget https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/irc_nas/18975/l_HPCKit_p_2022.3.1.16997.sh

sudo sh ./l_HPCKit_p_2022.3.1.16997.sh  #####  This will launch the GUI Installer as the root you can customise your pacakges according to your need.

Now we again need to Configure our CPU or GPU System for this follow:

sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install cmake pkg-config build-essential

Verify the installation by displaying the installation location with this command: 

which cmake

Set Environment Variables for CLI(Command Line Interface) Development: Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the setvars script

There are two ways for this:

Option 1: Source setvars.sh once per session (with every time opening the terminal): Source setvars.sh every time you open a new terminal window: 

. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

Option 2: One time setup for setvars.sh : Environment variables can be set up to automatically set using one of the methods below: 

sudo gedit /etc/bash.bashrc ## To open source file as a root

source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh intel64  ## add this command at the end of file and then save it and close it.


source /etc/bash.bashrc  ## Doing source changes made to source file(bash.bashrc)

One may use conda commands if he/she has conda environment in his/her mahine
